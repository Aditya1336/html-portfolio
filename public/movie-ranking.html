<h1>Some Amazing Reccomendations</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies of all time </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Love the artstyle and the story. Makes you feel like you are in a magical fantasy.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>Speaking of magical fantasy, this somewhat darker themed film compared to its magical and sunny prequels hit just the right spots when watching it on a rainy day, drining tea and lazing around.</p>
<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>This was the culimination of 12 years of wonderfully woven stories of Earth's Mightiest Heroes. I love it 3000!.</p>
